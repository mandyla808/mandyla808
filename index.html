        <h3>The University of Chicago</h3>
        <h3>Computer Science + Mathematics</h3>
        <p>I entered UChicago as a Math major, passionate about wrapping my head
          around abstract theories and developing elegant proofs.
          I then discovered the fun of coding in my first
          CS course; CS151 at UChicago. I really enjoy using the problem solving
          skills I've developed in math classes to build interesting and useful
          programs! Now I am pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics
          from UChicago. I am going into my 4th year this fall, and expect to
          graduate in June 2021.</p>
        <p>(sidenote: I graduated from Lowell High School in San Francisco.
          Go Cardinals!)</p>

        <h3>Large-Scale Systems Group: Cerebras Project</h3>
        <p>The Large-Scale Systems Group (LSSG) explores critical systems
          research questions underlying robust, scalable large-scale systems,
          including cloud, high performance, edge, and mobile/IoT computing.
          These systems have billions of elements, exabytes of data, and endemic
          impact on social, consumer, government, and scientific applications of
          unprecedented scale. Specific interests include cloud software,
          resource management, hardware and system architecture, and applications.
          LSSG is led by Professor Andrew A. Chien and has over 100 alumni !!!</p>

        <h3>UChicago Math REU</h3>
        <p>Students attend lectures and problem solving sessions intended to
          expose them to fields of math not typically covered in their
          undergraduate curriculum. Participants are then required to write a short
          mathematical paper on some problem or topic of their own choosing, in
          consultation with graduate students and faculty. </p>
